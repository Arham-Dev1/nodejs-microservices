# Microservices Made Simple: A Node.js + Mongoose + RabbitMQ Adventure

Welcome to this robust codebase crafted to showcase microservices in action. Using the power of Node.js, Express, Mongoose, and RabbitMQ, this application structure is tailored for building scalable, distributed systems.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to set up the project locally and start building!

1. **Clone the Repo**: Download the repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to get all the required packages.
3. **Configure Environment**: Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env` and add your configuration values.

## 💡 Key Ingredients

This project utilizes a few well-known technologies that make microservices and data management a breeze:

- **[Express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express)**: The go-to framework for creating fast, minimalist web servers in Node.js.
- **[Mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose)**: A delightful ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, making database interactions smooth and schema-driven.
- **[RabbitMQ (amqp)](https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html)**: An industry-standard messaging protocol for reliable message brokering between microservices.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

Here’s a peek into how this project is organized for clarity and scalability:

- **`app.js`**: The heart of the app. It initializes the server, connects to MongoDB, and loads essential routes and models.

### Key Folders

- **`routes/`**: API routing layer—defining how requests are handled and routed to the right controller.
- **`models/`**: Defines the MongoDB schemas using Mongoose, structuring how data flows in and out of the database.
- **`controllers/`**: The controllers act as middlemen between the request layer and the business logic—taking care of processing requests and returning appropriate responses.
- **`services/`**: Contains the brains of the application, where all core business logic lives. This keeps your application logic clean and modular.
- **`repository/`**: A data access layer implementing the repository pattern, abstracting MongoDB queries and transactions for maintainability.
- **`rabbit/`**: A microservice communication layer, handling all message dispatching with RabbitMQ, ensuring seamless service-to-service interaction.

## 🎯 The Big Picture

This codebase offers a clean and intuitive foundation for building microservices with Node.js and MongoDB. Its modular architecture ensures every part of the app has a single responsibility, making it perfect for scaling and evolving.
